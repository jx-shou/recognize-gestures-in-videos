# Recognizing Gestures from Videos using a Network with Two-branch Structure and Additional Motion Cues 
## Motivation
* With development of 3D convolutional neural networks (3DCNN), research of recognizing gestures from videos by extracting spatiotemporal features  is increasing. 
* However, 3DCNN is difficult to learn long-term motion information since motion information is reduced through subsampling layers.
* Networks of learning additional motion information are required.
